## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.
For this week’s assignment, I chose the theme "Surburbia". To fit this theme I picked the image  I took in Okinawa, which is a seaside lighthouse. 
Creating the perspective in Unity 2d is the most challenging part since the sprites in Unity 2d are limited. The way I solved it was to combine different sprites together and add shadows.

For example, the shadow on the lighthouse, the rock shadows. These shadows made the perspective clearer to the viewers. 
Also, it's hard to create cylinders and trapezoids in Unity so what I do is to combine triangles with rectangles so the cylinder shape will be more reasonable and viewers will immediately know what I'm creating. 
The overall image turned out that using combinations of different sprites to present shadows and complex graphs is successful. In the future, if I need to use Unity 2d sprites to create images, I will definitely use these skills. 
I think I’ve also learned a lot from the light and shadow. The shadow of the color will be affected by the object so it’s not pure black and the light is not pure white. 
It depends on the color of the objects. What’s more, the proper usage of color is able to guide viewers sight from one side to another. 




## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
5

It does recreate the vibe of surburbia where only the lighthouse stands along the sea under the bright blue sky. 


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
5

I played with different sprites to recreate the shadow in the real images and I think the overall visual effect is satisfying. 




**Overall** - Pass/Fail
Pass

The picture I recreate in Unity 2d present the vibe of surburbia where the viewers can feel the seawind and the bright sun from the clear blue sky. The only 
companion is the white light house who silently stood there.
