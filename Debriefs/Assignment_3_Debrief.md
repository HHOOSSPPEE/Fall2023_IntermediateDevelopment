## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

The goal was to make a title and menu that gave horrid impressions. Something that 
you would not look at for more than a few seconds. I was surprised to hear reviews contrary to this. 
A few people described my title “cute”; a huge distinction in a game menu that aimed to elicit a “cursed” theme. 
Perhaps my peers' sense of horror far exceeded mine. Nonetheless, the eye looming behind those red alarming
circles communicated something uncanny. It was especially apparent with ambient music sounding the illusion of 
terror coming for you. But I digress. The title was simple. I enjoyed that about my menu. Simplicity allowed cohesion
and proper discernment in hierarchy for elements on screen.  For instance, when you start Blot, the first thing you
observe is the eye. It is big and in the foreground. You can not miss it.  There are a few words at the bottom of the 
screen that read “Press SPACE…” to proceed but you do not render that before the eye nor the title of the game.I made 
sure of that.  While the start screen was visually simple, it was also simultaneously complicated. All it took was 
animation; a change in static and dull imagery to motion. Notice the eye floating, the text of the title 
wiggling, and the red circles expanding, growing bigger until they are no more. Each moving picture helps complicate 
the menu without hindering clarity. Similar to animations providing substance beyond simplicity, colors also seemingly 
played a role in adding depth. Red was an attention grabber. It helped that I learned about the color’s semiotic 
connotation with danger because it complimented the bizarre tone I was attempting to achieve. There were a few 
resources I found useful in completing this assignment but the one that was strikingly most useful was my notes in 
visual communication last semester.  Just like my notes on designing a game logo, I believed a game menu also had an obligation 
to be distinctive, appropriate, practical, graphic and simple in form to convey the game wholly. So I stressed it. 
Graphically, my menu could have used some improvement. The eyes work, but lack strength. In my strive and efforts for a 
simple menu, the graphic element was slightly neglected and turned out subpar. If I were to reiterate on this project, I would 
gauge the perfect amount of graphic that does not suspend the menu of its simplicity.



## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*4. Yes, objectively my assignment met the requirements in potraying a "cursed" theme. However, there are a few renditions that needs to be corrrected to strengthen the theme*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*5. I think I scoped the assignment well above the intended due date because I submitted the assignment with plenty hours to spare*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*5: All guidelines for the project was met. If all guidelines for the project was met then the assignment passes. *
