## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

        I probably ended up making a main interface that looks kinda sketchy. I tried to use the cross element and a black and gold color palette to mimic some of the more religious designs I've seen in other UI designs. But really Zealot doesn't have to be religious right? The excessive pursuit of money or knowledge can also be seen as zealous can't it? I think Monopoly is zealous.
        Games can become very stylized through UI design, such as persona5's impressive UI design. It's also a good idea to use the UI as a transition to some kind of "object", such as opening a book where the children are interactive UI elements. I think that's how the campsite billing was implemented in Red Dead Redemption 2. Incorporating UI into the game to avoid breaking immersion, or to actively break immersion, looks good. But for the main menu, there's very little in my gaming experience that has a particular purpose in the design of it.
        The logic of designing a menu really isn't the same as designing a game. Games are meant to give the player some challenge, but the UI needs to do something that doesn't create obstacles for the user at all, but also helps them as much as possible. Well that's a fascinating area to learn, but I don't seem to have anything in my brain Instruction Set Architecture that can execute these kinds of commands. 
        Well I can't say I really learned much from it, but https://www.gameuidatabase.com/ which I saw in slack earlier is a great site. For a quick look at various UI designs this site is perfect! 
        One thing to say my artistic aesthetic really ...... isn't ideal. I think Burgess Voshell is until that point, which is why my intro to vis com only has C's ...... But the good news is that in this class I might be able to put some of those art parts in someone else's stuff, or just simply represent them as placeholders.
        I spent a lot of time on this assignment trying to figure out how to express "Zealot" in UI. I think next time I'd rather use more time on UI animations and special interactions than wasting too much time on that. And UI design is a much more complex subject than I thought. The difference between horizontally and vertically aligned buttons mentioned in the lecture made me figure out why games basically have vertically aligned buttons (or horizontally aligned buttons for some vertically oriented text). It's really a way to save space and make interactions simpler.


## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*I believe it is zealot. Just not enough. I should have added more art.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4.5/5


*How they made the animation stuff?*


**Overall** - Pass


*I should put more into this project.*
