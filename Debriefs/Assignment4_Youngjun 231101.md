## **Debrief**
Here is where I would write my 400 word debrief. Within my debrief, I make sure to answer all the required questions.

This assignment was to make a pinball game using Unity physics. 
Making a pinball game sounded easy to me, but the challenge was how to make it creative and unique. 
The theme “command” was perfect for the project. 
Since the original pinball game has a lack of player control, I decided to add a special command the player enters to evoke the intense and dynamic aesthetics. 
In the original pinball game, the player controls two flippers that bounce the ball back to the upper place and a spring that launches the ball at the beginning of the game. 
In my elaboration, each control also works as a command. 
Players press left shift (left flipper), right shift (right flipper), and space (spring) in a certain sequence to change how bumpers are placed. 
For example, pressing “Space” “Left shift” “Right shift” “Left shift” “Right shift” “Space” will activate the command “SLRLRS” that disables two triangle bumpers in the middle and enables four triangle bumpers. 
Players can use command to gain more points by colliding the ball into more bumpers, or remove some bumpers that block the way to gain bonus points. 
As I intended, it provided players more control of the level’s shape and ball’s movement, and accelerated the tension. 
However, because the ball moves a little too fast and the level was too small, the game was already much faster than the original pinball. 
So adding the command system on top of that made it more difficult to keep alive. 
Moreover, during the playtest, I found that players misunderstood the concept and kept trying to succeed the command just after they launched the ball. 
Opposite to my intention, the game became chaotic and uncontrollable. 
To solve the problem, as I mentioned, decreasing the speed of the ball by adding more friction to the obstacles, increasing the size of the level, and making the command even easier, could be helpful. 

During the development process, making the ball launcher was the biggest challenge. Randy’s ball launcher is exactly the ideal one for me. It launches the ball depending on how long you press the button. I asked Randy how he made that and I’m waiting for his reply. Ultimately, I used the spring joint to hang the ball, and used the force the bar pushed the ball downward to make the ball have the force upward. This also launched the ball in a good way, but I’m not fully satisfied with it. 


## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*My elaboration*
Despite all the problems my project have, I really like the concept of my game. I'll continue develop the "Command Pinball" in the future. 


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4/5

*My elaboration*
This game is the most polished game I made in this class, but still need improvement. 


**Overall** - Pass
