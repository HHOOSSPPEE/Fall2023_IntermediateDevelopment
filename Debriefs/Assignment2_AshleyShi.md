## **Debrief**
I finally created a recipe for pancakes, with the player taking on the role of an egg. They can follow the instructions in the recipe book to watch an animated step-by-step process of making pancakes. In the end, they witness a complete pancake. As the player, embodying an “egg”, they also “sacrifice” themselves to become a pancake. This also aligns with my theme of “sacrifice” that I chose.
One of the aspects I mostly like is that my overall design of this game differs from other games with a “sacrifice” theme. Most other games centered around the theme of “sacrifice” are of the combat genre, and the overall tone of the game tends to be quite heavy. But the game I created has involve a cute and playful art style and a quite cheerful overall tone. It doesn't embody the traditional sense of “sacrifice”. 
When I was designing this game, I took inspiration from the style of a notebook. I wanted the main character to have the appearance of a recipe seen in the notebook left on the owner's dining table. So, I used a grid background resembling a notebook, with a red checkered tablecloth representing the table behind it. Additionally, I transformed all the step images into animations, and the final result turned out really well. The most challenging aspect of this assignment was to create the character - Egg move with also rolling. 
I used Procreate on my iPad to create all the drawings and animation assets. To make the entire game more vivid and immerse the player in the role of the “egg” I incorporated a rotating action into the movement code. When the player controls the egg to move forward, backward, left, or right, it will also roll in the same direction. This can be considered a “juice” element in the game.
When working on the next assignment, I will consider using a similar art style and color palette. Additionally, I will think about adding more 'juice' to make the whole game even more engaging. For this assignment, I feel there's still a lot I need to work on. For instance, as suggested by other classmates during the critique, I can make the art style of the egg more consistent with the overall game style. Also, when writing the recipe steps, I can use a pencil-style handwritten font instead of plain text. This will make the entire game feel more realistic and vivid.


## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*I gave myself a 5/5 because what I ends up having did meet my theme of “Sacrifice”, our protagonist – The Egg, is exploring the recipe and finally finds out how it will eventually to be made into a pancake. So, it’s the Egg’s Sacrifice.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5/5


*I feel my scoped of my work is great, I put a lot of thought and effort into creating the animation pieces. And make all the artwork the same drawing style and provide a cute and harmony feelings to my audience.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I meet all the criteria of this assignment by making several animations, with a moving main character in Unity and includes my own novel elaboration on the original theme “sacrifice”.*
