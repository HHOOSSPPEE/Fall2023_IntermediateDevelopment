## **Debrief**
I have ended up making a visual novel-type game for my final project, which is a clone of a psychology-related visual novel game called 'Adventure with Anxiety.' To enhance my main theme—tomorrow, I crafted the game's storyline around a college student grappling with anxiety and struggling toward the impending deadline of the next day. As the game begins, players discover two assignments on their in-game phone due at noon the following day. However, feeling excessively tired, the player plans to wake up early the next day to complete the assignments. Subsequently, players enter the protagonist's dream, where they engage in a conversation with an NPC, the Clockman. The dialogue choices made by the player during this interaction determine the game's outcome. The entire game has three different endings: one where the player misses the deadline for both assignments, another where the player misses the deadline for one assignment, and a third where the player successfully submits both assignments on time.

My favorite aspect of this game is that I have successfully implemented fungus inside of it. I've tried some cool effects in fungus, such as screen shake, changing sprites, and character alterations. At the same time, I believe I did well in creating art sprites. I experimented with small animations, added special blackout effects, and successfully illustrated various scenes and characters. I make my story engaging with my art style; in the scene when the player is inside Eva’s dream, I ensure the sound and background fit well with the feeling of being inside the dream.

I believe there is a lot of room to improve in this project. I did not spend a lot of time during the process of writing the scripts, so the story was not structured well. I might spend more time revising my story and making it more cohesive and well-structured. Also, I might want to implement more juice inside of my game, adding some animations for the characters. I also think I can remake the phone page, and make it an interactable page, it will be more interesting and juicier if the two assignment is clickable.

In the upcoming project, I also plan to keep on developing my fungus skill, I think there is a lot of other technique inside fungus that I could explore and try more, such as the drag and drop mechanics and the input name mechanics. I think Fungus is a great tool if I want to make narrative games with dialogue in the future. 




## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*I gave myself a 5/5 because what I ended up having did meet my theme of “Tomorrow”, I applied this theme to the story of my game, about how a college student struggling with his deadline for tomorrow noon.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5/5


*I believe the scope of my game is good, I have put three different endings inside of my game, to make my story more comprehensive.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I believe that overall, I did incorporate my main theme “tomorrow” into my narrative story, also I have successfully implemented and learned fungus. I think my overall art and music implementation also fits the overall mood of my game.*
