## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

Unlike the previous assignment, I had my theme selected and ready to work around it. 
The theme was perseverance; a steady persistent in a course of action. In other words, the tenacity to not give up. 
Conveying such ideas in a flat game was challenging and animating sprites to give the impression of tenacity was an issue of its own.  
I animated five sprites to translate three ideas of perseverance; bruised: a man who refuses to fall down despite being hurt badly,  
heavyweight:  a man who keeps moving despite carrying a heavy burden, and lost wings: a bird who struggles to fly. The first striking comment 
that I received on my game was about the animation dubbed “bruised”. Against my intentions, the class thought of the bruised man swaying in 
circles to be a man who was dancing. A slight confusion overcame me because I thought the bruised eye was very indicative of someone who is hurt. 
Although the assignment explicitly expressed “no collisions or interactions” for the game, I was happy to see my sprites interacting with their 
environment in lucrative ways that did not stray away from the constraints given. I made sure the sprites did not directly interact with one another, 
but players were given an illusory feel of interactions from color manipulations. It was quite simple really. All I did was match the background 
color with the sprites. For instance, if the background is red, the sprite will also be red. However, when the sprites move past the red 
background, more things are revealed about its appearance. I really enjoyed this aspect of the game and so did my peers. 
Using old Disney and Studio Ghibli character animations as references was really helpful in guiding my theme. 
It was especially apparent in the “heavy weight” animation. I was told “ you can really feel the weight in his steps and shoulder movement” 
which was flattering to hear and simultaneously resourceful. Perhaps if this sense of weight and liveliness was better illustrated 
in the other parts of the game then the theme would have been easier to identify. Next time this will be taken into consideration. 
I also suppose if the background played around with layering shapes and colors, more complexities would have worked in favor of better 
conversing the theme to whomever played. This was an interesting assignment. This is the first time I have made a game where the player does nothing but observe. 

	



## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*4. Yes, my assignment conveyed the theme of perseverance. There are situations where you can kind of lose the theme but it was consistent for the most part*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*5. I think I scoped the assignment well above the intended due date because I submitted the assignment with plenty hours to spare*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*5: All guidelines for the project was met. If all guidelines for the project was met then the assignment passes. *
