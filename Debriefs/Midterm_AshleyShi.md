## **Debrief**
I have ended up making a game that incorporates my two mechanics, dress up and pet care, and at the same time added my theme "Home". In the game, players can click on the wardrobe to change the protagonist's clothes, dresses, hairstyles, and shoes at any time. Players can also dress up the pet dog at home in the main scene, and they can drag food from the cabinet to feed the dog, thereby increasing its satisfaction bar. My theme 'Home' is reflected in the entire scene background. Within the scene, I've placed furniture, and there's a cat lounging on the sofa, creating a cozy home atmosphere. At the same time, players can open the wardrobe at any time to change their outfits.

My favorite aspect of this game is the successful and visually appealing dressing-up mechanics for the character. I created 5-6 sprites for each clickable section, offering players abundant choices. Additionally, I consistently upheld the girly style across the entire game, employing a pink and bright color palette to amplify the overall aesthetic. On the main home scene, I also incorporated the ability for players to dress up the dog, contributing a cute and harmonious element to the overall game style.

I believe there is a lot of room for improvement in this project. Initially, I intended to create a game where players fulfill the food requirements for a dog through food delivery. However, this mechanic encountered numerous bugs that I couldn't fix, so I modified it to incorporate a drag-and-drop food mechanism to satisfy the dog's satisfaction bar, emphasizing the 'pet care' mechanics. I plan to continue refining and maturing the food delivery mechanism in the future to enhance the overall playability of the game. Additionally, I intend to add sound effects to make the entire girly-themed game more lively and entertaining. I might want to use some cheerful sound effects and background music to fit the overall mood of the game.

In the upcoming project, I aim to further elevate the game's visual appeal by infusing it with vibrancy. Because of my experience in this project of making dress up and pet care mechanics, I have gained proficiency in scripting for sprite changing, dragging, and snapping. I intend to persist in utilizing these well-versed mechanics while introducing novel elements. This approach not only enhances the game's fluidity but also contributes to the refinement of my coding skills.



## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*I gave myself a 5/5 because what I ended up having did meet my theme of “Home”, I applied this theme to the overall art style and the background setup in the game.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4/5


*I believe the scope of my game is good but can still have plenty of space to get improvement. I did incorporate my two mechanics, but I think there is a better way that I can do it, and because of some technical issues I have experienced, I have abandoned my previous idea of making a dog food delivery game. So overall I give myself a 4/5 for space to get improvement in my final project.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I believe that overall, I did incorporate my two mechanics as well as my theme into my midterm project, despite the technical issues I have experienced, I will give myself an pass for overall.*
