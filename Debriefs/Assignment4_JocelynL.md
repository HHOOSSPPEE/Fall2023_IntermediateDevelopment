## **Debrief**

My game was “Mathball” using the theme “math class.” I liked playing around with the physics during the project and I think I got more familiar with them. I think doing physics in Gamemaker gets really complicated and annoying and the way that Unity uses physics is much easier for me to deal with. I also enjoyed doing the art for this game since I went with a blackboard chalk aesthetic, my drawings were a much looser to go along with the theme. I watched a video online on using button presses for the flippers and the way I saw it online was to adjust the amount of torque on the objects and limit the angle of the flipper using a 2D Hingejoint. I think it worked mostly but for some reason, my flippers always do a little spin around right when the scene loads in but I think I know why. It’s because the original sprites are flat but I tilted them for my flippers and flipped one of them too so I think that messed with the settings (probably). I got help from Jack during the lab day for the game and updating scores and I watched a video online to understand player prefs more. I also went to the Code Help Desk to help me with my “squash and stretch” effect which was a timer that transformed the objects for a second and went back after the timer ended. I also used this Google doc one of my friends shared with me that translates GML terms to their C# equivalent. I think the next time I do a project like this, I will try to make the player’s ball stand out more since I think even though I ended up drawing a new sprite for the ball, it still blends in with the other things on the screen. I’d probably make it stand out more by adding a trail to the ball or making a puff of particles after it hits something. I would also add more texture to the background since it feels very flat in contrast to all the other objects in the game that have a chalky/grainy texture. I’m proud of myself for thinking of the chalkboard sound effect whenever the player’s ball hits something, it’s a very satisfying and thematically appropriate sound so in future projects I will try to think of similar sounds I can do for those games. 

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*I think my theme fits aesthetically but not really gameplay wise since I don't think you could learn much from this game like in a math class.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I still struggle often when coding so I feel that my game was scoped well, not too big or small.*


**Overall** - Pass

*The game I made fulfills all the assignment requirements so I think it's a pass.*
