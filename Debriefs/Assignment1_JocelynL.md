## **Debrief**

I decided to use the theme 'mirror' to do my collage drawing of my bathroom. I liked getting used to the Unity controls and shortcuts. I think that this project wasn't too complicated but still helpful in getting used to layers and also using the play testing feature more often to check on how things actually look in-game. One of my friends was a useful resource since, I didn't know about this before but, they told me you could use the QWERTY keys to quickly switch between tools like the rotate, moving, and scaling tools. I considered getting a mouse because of this project, using the scroll wheel to zoom in just seems way more convenient than using two fingers to scroll on the trackpad (though I wish that Unity could just use control+ and control- anyway). The next time I do something like this I will try using the 3D feature to rotate my shapes on a different axis to make different shape more easily than how I actually ended up doing it in the project. Lowering the opacity of sprites to create shadows and highlights was very useful (and similar to how one might use layers with lower opacity on a drawing program so it's familiar to me) so I would definitely use that again.  

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*This is a bit reductive but there is a mirror in the drawing and my theme was 'mirror' so yeah I guess so.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I started my project a bit before class and I finished a lot of it during lab day. I think it turned out well and I'm satisfied with the end result so the scope is good.*


**Overall** - Pass


*My submission fulfilled all the requirements, was turned in on time, and (I hope) looked good so it seems good enough for a pass.*
