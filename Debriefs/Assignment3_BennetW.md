## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

- I made a scene. It is a scene in snow storm. In my opinion, a thing can always be connected to its opposite. My theme this time is "quite". Actually I was making a scene based on "promise". I tried to make it looks like hard. It's a long was and it's not easy. Storm. Yes, Storm. That is the first scene appeared in my mind after I decided to make such a scene of promise.
- Purity, Bone-chilling cold, silent, and helpless, those are what composed the "snow storm" in my mind. So I made a scene covered with snow, while there are still bare trunks and shrub branches. How to show that the wind is strong if it is just a flat game? First the visual aspect. The character should be in cloak. That's a great way of showing the wind. In games there the element "wind" is emphasised, the character is often wearing a cloak or something like that. Perhaps I should add some stripes on the cloak? I remember there's a website basically teaches you how to draw 2d pixel art, and animation. https://saint11.org/blog/pixel-art-tutorials/ This website really helped a lot.
- After I drew the player character's sprite, I found that This seems to tie in with one of my quirks. I really enjoy walking in the snow against the wind while wearing a long coat while looking back at my footprints with the wind at my back. The hem of my coat would float in front of me, and the scarf would sometimes even be blown in front of my eyes by the wind. When my eyelashes had frosted over, it was the ultimate silence. I was discussing with my friend about quiet and solitude, and we agreed that the ultimate state of solitude and quietness is not being alone, but rather wanting to get away and not being able to do so, and being surrounded by circumstances that are the opposite of the current feeling.
- You cannot talk in the snow storm. No one could hear you. The wind will make the noise, and snow will absorb your sound. You want to talk but there's nothing but the noise in this snow storm. I decided to change the theme to "silent".
- I want to express this feeling. It seems got a lots better way. I should consider more about this next time. I could add a mechanic that the player can shout out like in _Death Stranding_. The vastness and emptiness of the scene is expressed through the echoes of shouting and the lack of response. When there are traces of other people around, someone else responds to express the theme of "connection". Oh, I forgot there can be no interaction, so the second part won't work!


## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4/5

*For result, my project did meet the theme I gave it. Since I changed my theme halfway through, I decide to take one point off.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4.5/5


*I just don't want hard code for camera boundry. the rest is fine.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I should put more into this project.*
