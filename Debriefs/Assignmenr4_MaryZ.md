## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.
For the pinball machine assignment, I chose the theme "collect" since I think that the pinball hitting the shinning buttons to earn points is also a way of collecting points. Based on that,
I changed the figure of the marble into a small spaceship where the player can "drive" their spaceship to hit the stars to get points. Not only stars but also the sun and the earth. Always be 
careful about the black hole down there. I'm satisfied with the final visual of my pinball machine. It's a retro pinball machine that will remind you of the time when you play as a kid. I spend
a lot of time on triggering the animator with code to create the juice there. I think I'm confident in trigger animation and I will definitely use it in my future assignments. For the black hole at the
bottom, as I mentioned in class, I wish I could add the gravity effect so the spaceship will be dragged into it to mimic the real effect of the black hole. In addition, to have a more space feeling, add small 
gravity around the sun and the earth so the spaceship will float around them to present the real gravity there. In the future, I will add scripts for these effects to create the real outer space in this pinball machine and also increase its size. 
Because I also spent some time adjusting the physics material. The spaceship will sometimes accidentally stuck in the wall or smash out of the wall to the real outer space. I think if my pinball machine could be larger the spaceship can freely bounce around the stars instead of being stuck in the wall. 
In last week’s assignment, I had the problem of having two game manager scripts when I switched the scene so there were two background music played at that same time. To avoid this problem happening again, in this week’s assignment 
I added a few lines of code for detecting game manager and deleted the old one so the manager would not conflict. 
However, there’s still a problem due to the line “DontDestroyOnLoad” There were three game managers at the same time which caused the player couldn’t go back to the pinball machine screen when they were at the start screen. 
Thanks Jack helped me figure out how to solve this problem which was deleting the line “DontDestroyOnLoad”. 
In the future, I will be more careful about the codes of switch scenes and loading game manager. Another big problem I met was that I failed to build my assignment to HTML. I nearly gave up when I still could not build it when I remade it. 
Fortunately, I found the solution which was to delete the line of “using Unity Editor” to avoid the editor loading scripts when it’s building.
(Although I did not type that line when I was coding, it accidentally appeared) There’s a lot I learned from this assignment and I will know the way to solve these problems if I meet them in the future. 





## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
5

The player can collect stars while controlling their spaceship not fall into the black hole. 


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
5

I like the animators I create for the different objects to feel the space vibe.



**Overall** - Pass/Fail
Pass
