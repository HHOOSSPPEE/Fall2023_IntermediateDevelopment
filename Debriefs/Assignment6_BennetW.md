## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

I made a drawing game. Wait, does this thing count as a game? But I personally think drawing is a game, if you haven't needed to feed yourself (or plus your family) with the stuff. 

I do like to draw, so why haven't I admitted to drawing once during the semester? I'm not really sure, maybe because I still hold a disdain for my own drawings. Other than that, I think flowers are a perfect fit for my theme of Promise. I should probably mention here that when I say drawing, I'm talking more about drawing for things like Anime and more classical art. I don't really understand modern art. When drawing, the artist needs to try to faithfully recreate the look of the thing, but with a style of his or her own. It's all about the "thing" and the "style". In the case of my game (the way it's planned), the player draws in a kind of relay race, also respecting these two points.

Well there are people out there (and I'm one of them) who are happy to break the game, but that's one of the charms of multiplayer games. Drawing games aren't competitive after all, and with everyone's drawing time limited, the gap between levels can be narrowed, and it's an incentive for novice drawers to express themselves. Come to think of it, who's to say that you're not drawing well, and that you're deliberately break the game? Then the guys will think you're intentionally trying to create a funny effect. 

This project is, how can I put it, a scaled up version of a previous project, both in terms of SCOPE and time. I'm really glad I learned quite a few new things, but that's a problem I'll always face: I'm always overly inquisitive. Obviously I should try my best to make something playable first, and then think about adding things in afterward. After all, I forget who said, "Complex systems always start with simple but effective ones. " Maybe it was just whichever person mentioned it in youtube.

There are a lot of interesting tutorials on Youtube. Though what they teach is always relatively superficial (experienced programmers are enough to just read the documentation, right?) Superficial, but excellent for getting started. Anyway, just need to know, "Oh this is what this thing probably looks like" and then go to the docs to find something. And Jack was very generous in introducing me to the Compute Shader as well as Unity Relay.

The other thing that I really regret is my health issues. My parents, from a medical point of view, believe that I was the culprit in causing serious health problems at the last minute. I take exception to this view, but at the same time partially agree. Because there was just so much to do during finals week, my standard for eating became something along the lines of "this has enough calories and sugar to support me". Dietary fiber? What's that? Vitamins? Potassium? Hygiene? To hell with it. The result is that my gut has in fact been in an unhealthy state for over two weeks. Presumably some pathogen brought in by my roommate was the death blow that broke through my immune system.

It seems to be a matter of my attitude towards my life. Anymore health and well being is more important than my crappy GPA. My biggest regret is pushing through and continuing to code when I'm already sick. The result was that the illness that was almost healed got worse on Saturday and the plan went completely out the window. Perhaps the half hour or so I save each day to cook a good meal had come at me with a double dose of vengeance. Next time I'm definitely going to eat and sleep well and call the student health center if I'm not feeling well. Going there once is so much better than wasting a day in bed.

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 3/5

*I blieve that is not my fault.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4/5


*Just a little bit over-scoped.*


**Overall** - Pass


*You can draw, you can host and join games. I would like to call it pass.*
