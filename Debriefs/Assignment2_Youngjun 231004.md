## **Debrief**
Here is where I would write my 400 word debrief. Within my debrief, I make sure to answer all the required questions.

In this assignment, I had two limits, no collisions and no interactions. 
This made me wonder how I can make a game without collisions or interactions. 
Then, I found that UNIVERSE, the vast, infinite space, is perfectly reasonable to not having any interactions. 
So I built a UFO that looks very classic, even shoots a beam.
By separating the beam into several parts, I could make the animation and create the feeling that the beam is shooting downward. 
The Ufo moves 4 directions: left, right, up, and down; and each direction has own animation. 
To make the animations look better, I adjusted the shape of the beam and tilted the UFO so they didn't feel flat. 
Since the background is the space, I also made animations of stars and commets. 
Stars and commets are everywhere in the universe, so I wanted to randomly and infinitely create instances of stars and commets around the UFO. 
Then I searched on YouTube and found some tutorials that help me do so. 
The theme I chose was "alarm," perfectly fits with a dangerous UFO evading the galaxy. 
I made blinking "danger sign" and explosions that make it feel more dangerous. 
Jack mentioned that the animation of explosion is well made. 
Some people in class said that danger signs feel like fireworks. 

There were three problems that made me frustrated. 
First, the camera was too far from the UFO so the UFO looks too small. 
This also made my animations not quite visible, especially the UFO. 
During the presentation, I found that some people kept their eyes glued to the screen and observed the UFO and other objects.  
I tried to solve the problem by scaling screen size, but it only made the overall screen too small.  
Later I found how to move the camera closer to the UFO. 
Second, each object was too far apart others. 
The danger signs and explosions could leave such space between them, but the stars and commets felt artifical or unnatural. 
This might be the problem with coding. 
Third, the animations of UFO were glitching when moving. 
I still didn't figure out what made that problem, but I assume that its the camera. 

There was a building issue with my assignment, but Jack found that there were some codes that has no actual use. 
The problem solved by simply deleting them. 

Overall, the project met the expectation of the assignment's requirement, but didn't met my expectation. 
I was surprised that many people liked my project. 
But I learned more, so I can do better next time. 


## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*My elaboration*
The project was perfectly fit for the theme "alarm." 
The common cliche of UFO evading the galaxy immediately evoke the feeling of danger and warning. 
Flashing effects of danger signs and explosions contributed to the theme as well. 

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 2/5

*My elaboration*
The background of space was perfect for flat game assignment, but I can't satisfy with the assignment having serious problems. 

**Overall** - Pass
