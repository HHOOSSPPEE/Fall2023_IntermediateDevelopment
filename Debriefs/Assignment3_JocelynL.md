## **Debrief**

For this assignment, my theme was ‘influence’ so I made the title screen for a game where the idea of the game would be a visual novel and time management game where you play as a social media manager, personal assistant, etc. of a very famous (and a little problematic) pop star. My original idea for the theme was to either turn ‘influence’ into ‘influencer’ or to go with a cultish theme where the idea would be that the player would play as a cult leader with influence over followers but I decided I wanted to draw something more lighthearted and pop-y (not that you couldn’t do that with the cult leader concept though I guess). I really liked coming up with the concept and a little bit of narrative for this project and then coming up with something that could hypothetically be a part of that concept, especially the way I could control the art direction of it like the character designs and color scheme. I looked up how to use the Unity audio mixer online and I found a lot of useful resources to make the audio slider actually work on my project. I had a bit more trouble with the clicking sound effect’s slider but I ended up watching a few more videos on the audio mixer and sliders and I was able to fix it. The next time I do a project, I will definitely try to put more of my art on separate layers and also be more mindful of the size of my files. I have a bit of a bad habit of drawing all my components on the same canvas and also on the same layer because that’s how I’m already used to drawing digitally but unfortunately, it makes it really hard to add more animation and moving parts that can interact with the code. My background was also way too big for HTML, it looked correct in Unity but it probably would’ve been more useful to build the game and test it in itch.io instead hopefully this experience will make me remember to make my files smaller. I’ll also try to be more thoughtful about the font choices for long reading parts since I didn’t realize it was hard to read the About section since I wasn’t thinking too much about it while writing it. Something that I do want to do again though is the planning I did for the art side before I started the project since I ended up forming a color palette and making a reference board before starting and it helped me get into the mood of drawing.    

  

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*I think my theme fits pretty well, the idea of a celebrity influencing the public and their manager influencing them isn’t wrong.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I didn’t go too big with my scope and my project ended up being a pretty simple start screen while also fulfilling the requirements of the project so I think I scoped my game pretty well within what I think I was able to do for that week.*


**Overall** - Pass

*My game had the three interactable buttons, an options screen that was also interactable, another scene that could go back to the title screen, and fits the theme (sorta) so I think it’s a pass.*
