## **Debrief**
Here is where I would write my 400 word debrief. Within my debrief, I make sure to answer all the required questions.

The game I made was made to stand alone. More or less, you only received one experience. All of the game elements and interactions attributed to them held one purpose;  to communicate “heaviness”. 
If only I had  realized how simple it was to grapple with such an idea, I would not have spent most of my time running circles in my mind. So I stress it now. 
What better way to distinguish heaviness than to show its polar opposite. I mean think about it, how can you know something is heavy if you have never known something light. 
The principles behind my theme of “heaviness” became much easier to conceptualize and what's more, practical in play with this forethought.  The first pinball game made a point in 
suggesting the ball appear heavy through friction because if we postulate something is heavy it puts forward the idea that it is quite slow in movement and difficult to move. While the 
first game acted on this accord, the second game sought to do the opposite. Here, the ball was very light and especially fast. 

For the purpose of this distinction I want us to think of “light” not as in a feather but perhaps a ping pong ball. Whereas a light feather is very slow, a ping pong ball is very fast. 
If you don’t believe me, drop a feather and a ping pong ball at the same time and be amazed at how versed the English language can be in describing dissimilar things. Ignoring this short 
ramble, I hope you found reason in my explanation. The quality of my assignment in accordance with the requirements can be listed:

Did I make a ping pong game? Yes, Yes I did
Did I include a start screen ? Yes and I enjoyed this very much, especially the sound made when you click on the start button
Did I include a score count? Yes
Did I have a game over screen? Also yes.
Did I include 4 different types of physics interaction ? well…
.
Okay, I managed 3 out of the 4. Making a pinball game with physics other than bounce, springs, and hinges can be quite difficult. The way a typical game of pinball goes
 is as such: you pull the plunger and it springs up the ball, it then bounces on many different surfaces, and you try to use the flippers to keep the ball afloat-accruing points.  
 Though, now that I think about it, perhaps slides are also physics that interact with the ball. In that case, I managed to complete the assignment in its entirety :)


## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*5. Yes my project met theme of heaviness. *


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4


*4. The project was going well until unity decided to give up on me. From there, I had complications in how to approach my assignment*


**Overall** - Pass


*5: All guidelines for the project was met. If all guidelines for the project was met then the assignment passes.*
