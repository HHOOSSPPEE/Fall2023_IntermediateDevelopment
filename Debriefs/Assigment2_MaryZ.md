## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.
For this week's assignment with the theme "Revelry," I decided to create a flat game that would transport players to a festive atmosphere of the Luau in the game Stardew Valley. 
The Luau is a vibrant Hawaiian feast where villagers gather to enjoy delicious foods and participate in a fun beach party. Reflecting on my project, I think my game present the revelry in Luau and provide a tropical and passionate vibe there. 
Players can control Abigal to walk around the beach to feel the Luau at the beach.

Luau is a feast with all kinds of food and tropical vibe decorations there. So I chose to use the sprite sheet and the tile map in Unity to help me to put all the 
things I want in the map. These tools allowed me to efficiently design and decorate the game world, ensuring that it created a tropical vibe with all the necessary elements, from the sand to beach decorations and the feast for Luau. 
I also add different layers there so the shadow there will better present the perspective there. Although it's a bit confusing to import tile maps into Unity, the overall result turned out really well which is also a skill that I will probably do in the future assignment.
The other challenge I struggle with is the animator part. The transition part really confused me and I had a hard time figuring out which direction matches which speed. Thanks to the clockwise method, I 
finally realized how to fill in the character speed. Each time you fill in the speed in the transition line, think about which direction the character will go from at that moment, and fill in the corresponding number according to the pointing on the clock.
Though at first, I thought clockwise meant the transition lines in Animator should be clockwise. Seeing Abigal walk fluently under the player’s control really satisfied me. Since I learned the basic knowledge of Animator from this week’s assignment, I think I will add more complex animation like jump, 
and the idle state for each direction to the character in future assignments.  
The other skill I learned in this assignment is to deselect the waiting time of the transition between each direction’s animation so the animation will look more fluent. Also, adding more frames will smooth the animation so the movement will not look too awkward. 
The skills I mentioned above will all be useful in my future assignments. 






## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
5

You can directly feel the enthusiasm and the tropical vibe in Luau! I think the villagers enjoy themselves at the revelry. 


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
5

I think I meet the requirement there as I flat game that the player can control Abigal walks around the Luau with the rhythmic music.




**Overall** - Pass/Fail
Pass
