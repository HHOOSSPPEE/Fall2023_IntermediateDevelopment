## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:


	I ended up making a point and click garden adventure, focusing on being an assistant to the painter ‘Monet’. This included mini games where you could feed the fish in his pond, organize his desk and the main game of gardening and growing flowers around his garden. I like the game aspects of the mini games, especially the mechanics of feeding the fish, as I found the movement natural and effective, especially in their generated movements and their reaction to the mouse. The art style of the work was also a strong point of the game, as it emphasized this aesthetic quite well, and was cohesive with the theme. The many small animations added a level of movement to the game, and helped present this mood while also communicating the narrative. The animations of the characters were also well made, especially the walk cycle of the playable character, and it stayed within the same level of quality and style of the rest of the game. The use of space was effective in that it created the effect of Monet’s paintings where they are often stretched out and long, and this continuous use of space reflected that, especially when moving from indoors to outdoors, as well as moving from one side of the bridge to the other. Additionally, this also made the use of mini games with separate rooms more cohesive as they felt like ‘zooming’ into this large canvas, rather than an additional room. Furthermore, as the player couldn’t independently leave the mini game without completing it, it made the player’s awareness of this separation less active, as they only viewed the mini game in reference to the larger game. The resource of the line renderer was the most helpful, as it created a smooth animation of the fish tail, as well as the use of materials in order to create this effect. Personally, many of the issues were not large scale coding errors, but a disharmony between the different concepts I attempted to apply to the game – for example, my understanding of the ‘gardening’ mechanic and my understanding of a ‘point and click’ mechanic would overlap so that the player, instead of clicking on the plant to ‘plant’ it, would simply walk over to that location. Especially as the player attempted to collect water, it would force the player to walk into the pond, and ignore the past designated spaces for walking. This resulted from a combination of being somewhat unfamiliar with the program, and hence having to rely more on tutorials, and of a variety of tutorials providing clashing information and knowledge. To this, if I were able to repeat this project, I would attempt to create the whole system of gardening and walking combined (as well as specifically separating the walking and point inputs, so that walking could occur through WASD) in order to be able to effectively organize my code. Overall, the art direction and concept of this project were well-executed, and the small-scale mini games were also effective, even if bugs in the larger work prevented the plant cycle from activating. 

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4.5/5

*In terms of execution, I was leaning into the theme through the art direction – specifically ‘lush’ as in Monet’s gardens, and to this, the visuals were effective. Additionally, the concept of a minor narrative reflected this theme well. In terms of mechanics, the point and click mechanic worked – on the whole – well, as you could pick up objects into your inventory and ‘use’ them on other objects, as well as move through clicking. In terms of gardening, the fundamental code of ‘growing’ a plant works, as you can collect seeds and place them onto patches in the dirt, however, the plant cycle is more buggy in terms of the full plant cycle (by watering the plant). Overall, as the theme was related mainly to narrative and art direction – which were executed well – the project met the theme effectively.*

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 3.5/5

*In terms of scope, there were a few problems, mainly associated with my unfamiliarity of the program, and features that I believed would be simple (in reference to other programs) were more complex in this program. On this end, the mini games were well-scoped, as they provided the content they required. The art was also well scoped as I am aware and comfortable with how long the required art would take me, so I was able to prepare accordingly. Mainly, the issue with scope related to my reliance on a singular tutorial at the beginning of the project, where a lot of time was spent trying to recreate this feature, while also implementing my own specific features. This caused problems later down the line as I spent more time just trying to fix and restructure the code I had recreated, the more comfortable with the coding language I got. Overall, aside from the code of the larger point and click mechanic clashing with the gardening mechanic, the scope of the rest of the game (art, narrative, mini games) was well thought out, reflecting in the final product.*

**Overall** - Pass

*Overall, though I faced a few issues based on code and clashing tutorials, I feel that this was a very significant project as through fixing all this code, I was able to become a lot more comfortable with coding directly into Unity, and becoming more familiar with the language. I am quite satisfied with the art of the work, the animation and ‘feel’ of the game, as well as the narrative it followed. As such, I feel that beyond this course, I hope to revisit this project in order to provide it the functionality it deserves, and match the code to the art and narrative. : ) *
