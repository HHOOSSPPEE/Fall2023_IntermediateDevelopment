## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.
As this week's assignment is creating the menu and learning to use UI system in Unity, I chose the theme "Myth". My first impression of the word myth is a mysterious story.
So I made a menu that opened as a book and it's a book about the black cat's myth. The black cat image is on the left side while the options are all on the right side. I think this 
type of arrangement makes it easier for the players to click on the menu since most players are right-handed. Besides what we've learned in class, I add some small features inside the menu. Like I 
used sprite change for the button selection which is also the part I like the most. There are different button selections on the main menu and the saving menu. The main menu is the box selection, while
the saving menu is cat's scratch to fit the whole theme. The dialogue boxes have different responses to the button when the player presses it. In order to create a little bit of horror sense, 
there's a sentence like "You're scared". 
Adding the slider button for the volume control. Although it's a fake one that doesn't actually adjust the volume, I will learn how to bind the
volume in unity with this slide in the future. The other part I wish I could learn more about is the transition between the main menu and the saving menu. For this assignment, I just simply
made a fade-in and fade-out effect so the transition will not be that awkward. There are several parts here I wish to improve in the future. First, I would like to change the
transition into a more fluent and theme-fitted one like the player will feel like they're flipping the pages. The second part is that I wonder why the transition will play twice when I 
enter the saving menu. The third part is the music will also play twice when the player returns from the saving menu to the main menu. These two bugs I think I should fix these in the coding part and 
I will be aware of these problems in future assignments. For the class feedback about creating a more gothic and pixel style I think is a constructive suggestion. The cat and the book background there don’t seem really fit because one looks clearer the other is a bit rough. 
I will also be careful about this in the future. For the gothic style part, personally, I think that naming the game Bastet and designing the menu in Gothic style is also not quite fit, since Bastet is the Egypt Goddes. The mismatch of themes is the point I will improve in the future. 
Either the book should look like Rosetta Stone or change the title to another name. 











## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
5

The black cat myth will invite you into deeper secert story there. 


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
5

I think I meet the requirement there as a menu with basic functions there. Player can enjoy being little scared by the black cat. (^^)




**Overall** - Pass/Fail
Pass
