## **Debrief**
I have ends up making an interactive menu using my choosing theme – Key. In this menu, players can interact by clicking on the 'start,' 'option,' and 'info' buttons. At the same time, I convey the theme-Key of the entire menu, through background art and storytelling. In the 'info' button, I used concise text to explain the setup of the entire game, informing players that it's a story about a boy losing his key. Additionally, I included credits and music reference. In the 'option' button, I added two interactive elements: one for adjusting the volume and another for changing the game's resolution. In the 'Start' button, I incorporated a 'to be continued' screen to build anticipation for what will happen in the game.
In this project, my favorite aspect is the creation of background art and animations. I wanted players to be able to imagine the mood of the game as soon as they see my menu. Therefore, I used the background to establish a harmonious and pleasing mood for the players. The background features a grassy field with a few scattered trees and some rocks. There's a cat peacefully sleeping in the grass, and its dream bubble is connected to the frames of the buttons in the UI. At the same time, a boy is sitting on the grass, deep in thought about his lost key. A little white rabbit is hopping around the boy, and there's a bird flapping its wings in the sky. It creates an overall very pleasing environment for the player. 
I believe I need to improve my UI design for the buttons in this project. There are some discrepancies in the sprites of certain buttons and the overall feel of the game. For example, when creating the drag bar for the sound control in the option button interface, I used a pink sprite for the background of the entire bar. However, the overall color scheme of my game leans towards warm tones, with a storybook feel, so the introduction of pink in this context seems somewhat out of place. I think it would be very helpful for me to search for UI references online and learn how to create better UI materials.
I believe that in my next project, I will also create something that gives players a very pleasing experience by using an appropriate color palette and lively animations. However, I will also strive to improve the animations further. In this project, only the rabbit and the bird are animated. If I can animate the speech bubbles as well, the entire project will have more of a storybook feel. Additionally, the bird's animation will need to include more sprites to make its flying motion more dynamic.



## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*I gave myself a 5/5 because what I ends up having did meet my theme of “key”, I incorporated the element of 'key' into the story of my game, where our main character, a boy, sat on the grass because his key was lost and couldn’t goes back home.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5/5


*I feel my scoped of my work is great, I put a lot of thought and effort into creating the background illustration and the animation sprites. And create a harmony color pallet as well as a pleasing environment.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I meet all the criteria of this assignment by making a menu that players could interact with by clicking the buttons, it’s playful, pleasing, and cute.*
