## **Debrief**
When I first conceived my main theme, 'breaking news,' I was sitting at my desk, struggling to come up with an actual 'breaking news' scenario. I started to ponder what would constitute 'breaking news' for me in that moment. The thought occurred to me: if my computer were to break, it would undoubtedly be a significant event.
So, I decided to capture the scene before me in a photograph: a computer on my desk, surrounded by various papers. I then transformed it into an illustration using basic elements from Unity. I created several horizontal lines of different colors to symbolize a broken screen. Additionally, I included newspapers beside the computer to emphasize the 'news' element. With the 'broken' computer, it could also be interpreted as a piece of 'breaking news.'
The most challenging aspect of this assignment was recreating the keyboard for the computer. I want my audience to directly tell it’s a MacBook, so i need to carefully restoring each key and ensuring their proportions were accurate. I incorporated subtle shadows to give depth to the keys. Adjusting the proportions proved to be tricky, but the final result turned out great, and it's the part I am most satisfied with. To enhance realism, I also create a MacBook Type-C charger, using a similar color palette with slight variations to achieve a layered effect.
Throughout this assignment, the color palette proved invaluable in selecting shadow hues. By manipulating saturation and brightness, I achieved a compelling 3D effect beneath the keys. I intend to continue using this color palette to enhance the layering effect in future 2D perspective illustrations. One aspect I still need to fine-tune in this artwork is the background colors. I may experiment with adjusting the background and table colors to harmonize them better with the overall mood of the piece, perhaps incorporating additional light and shadow effects.


## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*I gave myself a 5/5 because what I ends up having did meet my theme of “breaking news”, the broken computer is a “breaking news” and there are newspapers on the side with the broken computer can also represent “breaking news”*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5/5


*I feel my scoped of my work is great, I put a lot of thought and effort into creating a meaningful piece. And incorporated elements of broken computer screen, newspapers, and the MacBook keyboard. Additionally, I use of color palettes to create depth and shadows that could also demonstrates a great approach to the overall composition.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I meet all the criteria of this assignment by using 200+ of the default elements in Unity and includes my own thoughts that become an elaboration on the original theme.*
