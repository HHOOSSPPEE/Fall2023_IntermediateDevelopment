## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.
The theme of my final project is "jealous". Although I save it till the last since I think this will be an interesting one to play around, it took me some time to find the proper clone game and 
the exact part I wish to clone. My clone game is Stardew Valley but I only pick the mini fishing game to clone it. Combining with the "jealous" theme, player is envious of Willy owning such a 
high-quality fishing rod. So they wish to challenge him to win the rod. I'm really proud of what I made in the end. As you play the game, you will immediately feel like you’re playing the original 
Stardew Valley game. Through the process of breaking down this fishing game into different status, I 
watched videos about Stardew Valley fishing again and again to clone all the animation and take note about all the steps in fishing.
I learned a lot when I'm working on the coding part to recreate the fishing game. Though there's still some small bug in the animation part, overall the fishing game works well. 
Using enum to do the state machine is extremely helpful which I will also use in the future projects. Furthermore, I will try to improve the logic in my code since the state machine both exist 
in two separate scripts. Therefore, if there's a bug it will be hard to track which part went wrong and figure out the way to fix it. What’s more, the if statements for each state are also becoming 
longer and longer to avoid the bugs happening. Therefore, in the future assignment I will try to build a more logical state machine to handle different states for players, NPCs and enemies. When I was cloning the game, 
I was really impressed by how Eric Brone developed this whole game by himself. Because fishing in the game is a very fast  process, may each time casting rods and pulling back rods at most cost ten more seconds, but this 
contains a chain of interlocking logic behind the chain that needs to be distinguished into many small states to ensure that each link of fishing will not be wrong. In addition to the code I spent quite a bit of time on replicating 
the original fishing animations. As I said before, although the process of fishing only lasts about 10 seconds, the original animation makes fishing very vivid. So I did my best to reproduce some small details, such as the splash 
of the bait into the water, and the little tiptoeing when casting the rod, to make the whole fishing process look less stiff.
All in all this project was one of my proudest of the semester, using all the knowledge I had previously learned in this class and giving me a more comprehensive and better understanding of unity.







## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
5

Players will feel intense fishing battles to win prizes.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
5

The mini fishing game did cost my whole 2 weeks to clone it. It overall present a complete and interesting one. 



**Overall** - Pass/Fail
Pass
