## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

When the unity sprite project was assigned, I did not know what to photograph. My first thought was to browse through my 
phones photo gallery, where I was sure at least one of my many photos would match one of my themes. I scrolled and scrolled until I came 
across a recent picture of my cat laying on my bed. For a person who was struggling to form ideas, I was especially pleased 
to discover a toy laying besides my cat; a glaringly present theme that I would later take up. While the picture's intricate details of my cats body and bed sheets  
proved somewhat challenging to replicate with 2D sprites, it was also simultaneously fun. I enjoyed coming up with solutions to my inconveniences.
For instance, manipulating 23 circles to bring about one stroke and outline for an object. It was tedious work but the results were pleasing. 
I was not the only one who had these thoughts. My peers, who observed and critiqued my work in a similar manner was an indication. Among the class, 
one critique mentioned "shadows and layering". I found the discussion on these topics very useful. Similar to how you would paint on a canvas, unity required you to 
layer multiple objects to form one subject in picture. This is something I am sure will be repeated in multitudes on my game design journey. 
	



## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*5 : Yes, my project met my theme. I feel as though it is very apparent with the rubiks cube in frame. However since that held very little substance , I decided to indirectly commmunicate a second toy; the paper lantern. While I use it for lighting, my little cat finds it very useful in play. *


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*5: I think I scoped this project very well relative to it's due date. I truly believed it could be accomplished within the time given and it was.*


**Overall** - Pass/Fail


*5: All guidelines for the project was met. If all guidelines for the project was met then the assignment passes. *
