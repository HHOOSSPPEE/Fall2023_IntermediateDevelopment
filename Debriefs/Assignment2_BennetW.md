## **Debrief**
In at least 200 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

-  I made a picture. It was based on a photo I took last Christmas in gamecenter. I saw this cyber fireplace were set against the wall alone. The wall is white, floor is gray, and the light is in cold tone. Wierdly only the table and the monitor looks warm. Contrast and tone, 80% primary colors and 20% contrasting colors, a painting technique I learned from my drawing teacher. The cold winter made the fireplace even warmer, wasn't it? Actually there's not much to do in this project if I'm not plan to spend a lot of time in the project. I did enjoy making the "ASUS" brand in this project. I can't say there's any resources helped me because... It's just a image. If maybe I'll find some tricks help me make the project better? I forgot how to use Grid snapping. It was painful trying to manually align the more than two hundred squares that make up the flame.


## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*A sort of Cyber Christmas fireplace, very gamecenter style. The color of the fireplace and the color of the tablecloth provide a "warm" feeling in terms of tone, and warmth is given by heat. The heat of the Cyber Flame is emphasized even more by the contrast of the seemingly cool-colored walls.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*This is just a image.*


**Overall** - Pass


*A good start for this class.  *
