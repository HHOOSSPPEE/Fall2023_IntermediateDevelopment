## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the gameâ€™s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

Please do not answer these questions individually, but include it in a paragraph format.

Based on the gacha and relationship mechanic, plus the theme of responsibility, I created this dating simulation game for the midterm project. The background of this game
happened in a forest. Our protagonist is a college student who enjoys wandering in the forest and exploring nature. The sudden appearance of the gacha machine breaks the silence there.
The player will be played as the protagonist to gacha and build relationships with the creatures that are trapped in the gacha toy. It's a story-heavy game so I spent half of the time on
learning how to use Fungus to apply my words to the game and also writing the plot. It's a short story but I'm proud of what I finally came out. It's a story between a wolf 
and a girl, the relationship between civilization and the wild. A long journey that brings the lost soul back to her hometown. 
Besides the plot, the other part I spent a lot of time adjusting to is the transition between different screens.
At first, I created several scenes to shift between them. However, how to save the data between the scenes became a big question. Eventually, with the help of my friend. I put 
all my screens inside one scene. Therefore, the shift between the screens was actually closing and opening the sprites there. For example, when the player needs to enter the gacha screen
to the character screen, I use the UI to close all the sprites in the gacha screen so the player can see the character screen hidden below it. It's a bit complicated and confusing when
I adjusted the closing the opening sprites. Sometimes, the sprites were in chaos and the one that should be closed still appeared on the screen. But I'm glad that I've finally figured out how to apply it. 
I will use this tricky way to do screen transitions in my future assignments. Building different scenes is probably the way to do games that have several levels so the data will refresh each time when the player enters the scenes. 
For the dating part, I want to add more characters in the future and the most important is the save load function. For now, the story will restart when the player reenters. 
Fungus has its own save and load system so I will figure out how to implement them in my game. Also I wish to add a small tutorial in the game to illustrate the background of the story so the player will not get lost when they enter the game.







## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5
5

The responsibility to save the soul trapped in the gacha toy and build relationship with them.


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5
5

I tried several new stuff in my game such as Fungus, Twine, applying lots of arraylist for the gacha, so I think I cover a lot in my midterm project.




**Overall** - Pass/Fail
Pass
