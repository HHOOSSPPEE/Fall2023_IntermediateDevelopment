## **Debrief**

The mechanics I got for this project were fog of war and bullet hell and my theme was escape, which are all pretty self-explanatory for what kind of game I made. I liked that for this assignment that everyone got assigned different mechanics for this assignment because we got to see many different games on the showcase day. I think that it was pretty ambitious for me to pick these two mechanics in particular because I really don’t think my coding skills are super up to snuff enough to handle them very well but if the assignment was finished I’d consider that a win. I do kind of like the game I made though, mostly because of how unfamiliar this type of game is for me. I really like the built-in trail emitter that Unity has because I know for a fact that coding that into GameMaker would’ve been very tedious for me. I also like the health bar of my character and I was planning on changing the little face’s expressions as the player got closer to dying but I didn’t have enough time with everything else I was doing. I ended up reading and watching a ton of tutorials for coding this project, also Jack was very helpful during lab days as usual. I also made my own tileset for this project which was a first for me. I think that Unity is really good for importing tilesets because it’s pretty intuitive and most of the problems I had were because I drew my tileset a bit wrong and also I didn’t plan out a map for my game really clearly so it’s a bit too easy to win the game. I think if I made this game again, I’d alter some of the controls for the player’s dash to follow the mouse instead of just going in the direction the player is already facing. I haven’t played a lot of games on the computer since I don’t have a gaming PC and stuff so I coded the controls similarly to how they would work with a controller without a mouse accounted for which is why I didn’t think of the dashing towards the mouse idea. The fog of war part of the game also doesn’t really impact the gameplay that much since I didn’t make it dark enough but that’s partially because when I was coding the game on my computer my brightness was pretty low and I didn’t take that into account when I was adjusting the lighting settings. Honestly, even though I like the game I made, I still have a lot of regrets regarding the way I made it but most of those regrets come from the fact that my dumbass (sorry about the language) decided to join my friend’s Game Center unofficial Game Jam weekend event because I thought it would be nice to support this event that is meant to help students from different grades in the Game Center meet and become friends or something along those lines but instead I just stayed up until 4:00 AM for like three nights in a row (I did make new friends though sort of). I guess you’re going to see this when you open the project from the GitHub but the way I did the walls and collisions was really dumb so I’ll just explain it here. After I drew in my map for the game I realized that the layering on my tile maps was really off and I wasn’t sure how to add collision to tilemaps so I ended up making separate wall objects that are all set with low opacity so that you can’t see them and I ended up making over 50 rectangles to outline all of the walls in the game and it was actually a total mess. So if I had this assignment again I would start planning it earlier and I would also think more about the fact that the game would be played on a computer. I think if I had more time on this assignment I’d also try to make some more enemy prefabs with different bullet patterns since all the ghosts act the same. I think I’d also try to look at what’s up with the ordering in my code that’s making the dash cooldown not work for some parts for some reason.
Happy Late Thanksgiving depending on when you read this, thanks for reading.        


## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*I guess? You win by escaping so yeah.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4

*I scoped my game to have a beginning and an end with a lot of stretch goal ideas most of which did not get implemented but I think the fact that you can win and lose in this game pretty reasonably means that it was scoped well.*


**Overall** - Pass

*The game was done...Yup.*
