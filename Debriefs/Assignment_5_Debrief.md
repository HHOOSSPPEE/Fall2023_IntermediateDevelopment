## **Debrief**
Here is where I would write my 400 word debrief. Within my debrief, I make sure to answer all the required questions.

This is a stealth game- or at least it is trying to be one.

CounterSpy, a side-scrolling stealth game I played once upon a time, was the inspiration. 
While making my game, I realized I enjoyed fidgeting with the physics of level design more than stealth. 
At first, I aimed to seize stealth and invisibility for the game's essence: giving players the 
ability to disappear and reappear, limiting how long they were able to go invisible and then 
visible again... This was my focus and it all seemed quite banal. It would certainly highlight 
that I tackled the constraint that I was given. No doubt. But that alone was enough to make a game.

Within my code and design, it was crucial for what I built to be fully functional, and wherever 
possible allow the game mechanics to communicate a purpose beyond the obvious. Therefore my approach 
to grappling with a stealth game changed on the grounds of self-questioning. The player has the ability 
to turn invisible. So what? Why does that matter anyway? These were some critiques among many that
began to spark answers on how to fix my boring old stealth game. And to no surprise, the answers came in full. 
I was already lucky enough to acquire collectible game items as a secondary game mechanic. Now all that 
was needed was carefully crafted levels to necessitate the two. Sneak around and pick something up. 
This sounded more fun than the latter. Yet still not enough to count as a game. I needed obstacles. 
I need uncertainty. I needed something to contest my player and make the mechanics worthwhile. 
Aside from these concerns,  there was another; how to implement my theme of “grounded”. I did not 
want to merely convolute the two ideas because a grounded game implied a collision of sprites to the ground 
and there was nothing special or unique about that. Here, I yearned for something, anything the least bit 
clever to add charm to my game. 

Just like most, I did a little digging in forums and YouTube videos- a fairly practical approach 
for research- and found a video titled “How to Make Softbody Physics in Unity!”. Most stealth games have a 
great deal of elements that scream stealth but few exist that contain elements as silly as a soft body physic. 
As such I thought it to be an ingenious inclusion to my game and I loved it. What's more, playing with it 
gave rise to the idea of tackling my theme of being “grounded”. 
*Hint* It is in the second level. 




## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*5. Yes my project met theme of grounded. *


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4


*4. A lot was accomplished within the scope of 2 weeks. Yet there were a few things I was dissapointed to not have been included*


**Overall** - Pass


*5: All guidelines for the project was met. If all guidelines for the project was met then the assignment passes.*
