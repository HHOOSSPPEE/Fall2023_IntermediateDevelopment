## **Debrief**
In at least 400 words, write a debrief. You must write a reflection on your assignment. In addition to specific requirements stated for the assignment, you must answer the following:

- What did you end up making?
- Which of the game’s aspects did you like about this project?
- What resources and/or comments were most helpful to you?
- What will you repeat or do differently next time?

I ended up making a recreation of the Saint Patrick’s cathedral, however, I had also adjusted the color balance, tone curve, and gradient map, in order to create a more atmospheric effect within the image. This also added a contrast to the different objects within the image which emphasized its coherence to the viewer. Additionally, I also added some narrative elements, such as blood spilling from the windows as well as a wedding with blood staining the wedding dress. This was effective in the wedding dress, as the white and red contrast was distinct, however, the red of the lighting and the blood did blend in to where it did not add any effective atmosphere. I enjoyed the level of detail and perspective that was gained through the final ‘game’, and this was achieved through a combination of multiple rectangles in a triangular form, as well as thin triangles that mimicked the thin slivers of shadow and lighting. The strongest aspect was the golden stage in the front, as the heavy level of detail and color contrast (more yellow when compared to the scene) allowed for the viewer to draw their eyes to the center of the piece, then outwards towards the symmetrical pillars on either side which aided in creating a sense of grandiosity and space. The resource of the keyboard shortcuts was highly beneficial, as it streamlined the process of creating new objects and folders with ease. Furthermore, it also aided in preventing objects being accidentally created within other objects (which created a parent object). Here, I used the keyboard shortcut of ‘Command L’ for quickly creating squares, ‘Command ;’ to create diamonds and so forth. On a tangential note, the use of duplicating and mirroring groups of objects was also useful, as it allowed me to quickly reflect large amounts of elements within the piece, which also created a sense of symmetry. This included the seats in the front, as well as the pillars near the edge of the piece, where I flipped the x-coordinate to negative in order to mirror their placement while still having them all have the equal amount of distance from one another. Though this work was enjoyable and as I worked, I became more used to the program at a fast pace, the first few hours felt frustrating as I was working very slowly and ineffectively. I believe that if I had focused on a less demanding piece, I could have balanced a sense of learning the program whilst not spending a majority of hours just doing ‘busy’ work. I had gone back and attempted other pieces (one based upon Edward Hopper’s ‘Nighthawks’) which would have been technically demanding but not consisting of a heavy amount of detail and miniature details. Though the piece was effective and I am satisfied with the result, there are some details within it where I would have appreciated more detail to create coherence, such as the detail-work within the pillar’s top pieces. I opted to use larger shapes in order to convey the concept of detail, in that situation, as the actual level of detail would have been its own few hours of work. Overall, I am quite pleased with the results and did enjoy the process once I got used to the program and was able to streamline my work with the use of keyboard shortcuts. 



## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*My theme was ‘Empty’, and I wanted to achieve a sense of emptiness not through a blank image, but rather, an emptiness of a space that is commonly full of people and events. Here, the vastness of the cathedral added to that effect, as it made the room feel large and empty of action or movement, and had an overall sense of stillness. In this sense, I believe my project fit the theme I gave it, and the interpretation of the theme, as it created a specific type of emptiness.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4/5


*Within scope, though I was able to complete the game within the allocated time, I believe there was an overreach in work and effort, as a similar effect could have been reached within a shorter amount of time. The piece took about 10 hours to complete, however, it must be noted that during the start of the project, the work was a lot less streamlined as I was still getting used to the program and its layout. Other than that, the game was well scoped in terms of being complete by the assigned due date, and with enough time to have completed it by the lab (Wednesday).*


**Overall** - Pass

*Overall, I am quite satisfied with the result, and am pleased that the effect and atmosphere I was attempting to recreate was effective, and that the level of detail translated well within the program, even if we did use primitive shapes. The restrictions within this assignment also provided a level of creativity to emulate suggestions of detail rather than attempting to fully recreate my sourced image. This also strengthened my skills within colors and perspective in visual communication as I had to effectively communicate the level of detail and elements within the work without being able to directly draw the natural shapes.*
