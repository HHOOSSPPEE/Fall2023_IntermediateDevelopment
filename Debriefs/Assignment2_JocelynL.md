## **Debrief**

For this assignment, I used the theme ‘marketing’ to make a flat game set in a night market. I really liked that I got to draw a lot for this project and that, because there weren’t any interactions in the game, I could focus more on how I wanted things to look. Also, I did all my game art in Aseprite and it helped me get used to the program's shortcuts and tools. It’s pretty different from what I usually use since there are no clipping layers and also a lot of the keyboard shortcuts are different but it’s a really good program for pixel art. I ended up coding in limits for my player and camera so they couldn’t go endlessly offscreen and I referenced some YouTube videos for those parts. I think that I have a good enough understanding of how the code works for the limits but the actual numbers to set the limits were pretty trial and error. It was really nice to get the tutorial for the animation web in class because there is no way I would’ve gotten how to do it otherwise. For the background of my game, I drew it on a really big canvas and then imported it as a PNG. Maryam’s comments in class were useful when she said it probably would’ve been better to draw the market stalls as separate sprites and then put them into the game. Thinking back on the project I was going to draw the market stalls separately and for some reason I just didn’t it ended up making things pretty difficult for me since I zoomed out to draw some parts and the lines ended up really sharp and not rounded like I would’ve wanted them to be.  So, the next time I draw a background like this I’ll make sure to do each part separately. It’ll also be easier to arrange the scene this way. She also commented that it would look good if I added a shadow for the player character and if I do another project similar to this one, I will definitely try to add a shadow on the player’s sprite so they can look more like they’re in the scene. If I had more time I would’ve also drawn an actual walking-up sprite instead of using the side-walking sprites. I would’ve also liked to draw making a turning animation but I wasn’t sure how to put it into the game. I think I sort of made things more difficult for myself by using a person as my player character instead of a simpler character design though, it’s not something I would change. 
  

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

*The game is set in a market and, I mean, 'market' isn't necessarily the same as 'marketing' but I think it's fine.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I think some parts of the scene feel a bit empty and I wish I made more NPC sprites to put into the scene but my flat
game fits into the requirements for the assignment so I think it was scoped well.*


**Overall** - Pass


*My submission fulfilled all the requirements and was turned in on time. Also I think I did pretty good.*
