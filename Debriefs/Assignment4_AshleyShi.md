## **Debrief**
In this assignment, I used "admire" as my theme to create a SpongeBob-themed two-player Pong game. In this game, one player (SpongeBob) moves up and down using the W and D keys, while the other player (Patrick) uses the Up and Down Arrow keys. Their goal is to hit the burger into the opponent's territory to score points. The player who reaches 5 points first wins the match. My theme "admire" is reflected at the end of the game, where the winning player holds up a "winner" sign, while the losing player admires the victorious one. Because I wanted the overall mood of the game to be very humorous, I used art sprites and sound effects to highlight this sense of humor. Additionally, I added spinner and bumper elements, allowing both players to control one of the bumpers to hit the opponent's territory more quickly.
In this assignment, my favorite part is the game's sound effects and art. This is because the sound effects and art are the elements that help me best convey the sense of humor. In the initial menu screen, I used an audio clip of SpongeBob continuously saying "I'm ready," which immediately gives players a funny feeling. The background also depicts SpongeBob and Patrick back-to-back, looking very aggressive, as if they are ready to start a battle at any moment. In the game, most of the art sprites I drew are elements from the SpongeBob cartoon, such as the Krabby Patty, spatula, broom, and dumbbell. The facial expressions and sound effects at the end of the game are also very humorous. For example, when SpongeBob wins, he raises a sign that says "winner," while Patrick, on the side, has a board with "admire" nailed to his head, and his facial expression is also full of admire. 
There are many improvements I can make in this project. For example, adjusting the saturation of the in-game background to better fit the bright color palette of the entire game. I can also add more interesting interactions. As a two-player game, besides allowing both players to move vertically, I can also enable them to move horizontally, influencing and even attacking each other. I could even introduce special abilities, like allowing them to 'eat' the ball in the game (which is like a hamburger). This would better match the overall humorous atmosphere of the game and enhance its playability.
I believe that in the next project, I will also try to incorporate the element of bumpers and utilize physics. These elements will make the game more interesting and diverse. At the same time, I will continue to maintain my unique interpretation of the theme because I always enjoy exploring new things. I think ensuring that my art sprites and theme align will also be something I will continue to focus on.



## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5/5

*I gave myself a 5/5 because what I ends up having did meet my theme of “admire”, I applied this theme in a very unique context. I portrayed it in a humorous way, and the “admire” will be reflected on the screen when one of the players wins. This humor can be seen in the art of the end screen.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5/5


*I believe the scope of my game is very well-defined. I've emphasized a sense of humor throughout the entire game, from the art, music, to the gameplay itself. I not only used SpongeBob and Patrick as the main characters, but also included SpongeBob's sound effects, which added to the overall comical atmosphere of the game.*


**Overall** - Pass


*I believe that overall, I not only integrated my main theme into a unique context, but I also infused the original 'pong' game with a highly humorous atmosphere. Additionally, I incorporated several physics elements into my game, which meet the overall requirement for this assignment.*
