## **Debrief**
The game I made is a partial clone of the game Your Turn to Die where the thing I tried to clone is the original game’s “Extract” and “V/S” mechanic. I decided to try cloning this game because my theme this week is “secret” and the whole point of the Extract and V/S mechanics (or Push and Dispute for my game) is to learn information that would otherwise be a secret. I think my current game somewhat fits the theme but it would’ve fit more if I didn’t end up scoping down my game a lot. The game was originally going to have a much more serious story about a murder at a dinner party but for this kind of story, I felt that I would’ve had to draw a lot more characters/assets and write a way longer script and the time I had was just not long enough to fit this kind of project. The scoped-down version is a much more light-hearted story but still set in the same time period. Even though I scoped down, I still ended up liking the project I made a lot. I liked using the Fungus plug-in for this game, it was very convenient and that made me happy to use it (especially after experiencing the Intro to Programming final where I had to build my dialogue system myself). I also enjoyed having more time than our previous homework assignments to work on this game because I think it helped me make a game that I’m proud of. I heard that the other Game Development sections did month-long game clones but I’m glad we didn’t have to work on a project for that long because it would’ve given me more stress for the assignment. I also liked drawing for this project a lot mainly because I had a lot of freedom to design characters and the game’s UI in the way that I wanted. I watched a lot of Fungus tutorials to get a better understanding of all its features and it’s a really useful tool that I would consider using again even if it wasn’t for a full visual novel-styled game. I did run into a few issues while coding the game though but I think those problems may have come from the fact that I moved onto a different computer. While I was on my original version of the project I had to do some coding for the Push/Dispute part of the game and the line “using Fungus;” was not registering. I looked online and some sources said it might be an Intellisense problem or something. I ported everything from that file to a file that I knew already had Fungus functioning properly on it though and it worked out fine so a solution was found at least. For the next time I make a game like this, there are a couple of changes I would make. For example, I think I should’ve made a more clear sign for when the player was using Push or Dispute. I think that I’ll probably code in something in the future to either show/hide based on whether the player is pushing/disputing or not as a simple indicator. I also think the tutorial for the Dispute mechanic can be a little clearer, either that or to change the order in which the buttons are pressed to be a bit more intuitive. I also think the mechanics in the game ended up being a little janky because the original game of Your Turn to Die had a similar order for clicking but more clear visual signs and also a larger cast to justify clicking on what. When I update the game, I want to add a text box that says “Dispute (character name)’s statement with which other character?” or something like that so the player understands that they have to click someone else’s portrait. In the future, for a project like this, I will also avoid pulling two all-nighters in one week both on nights before having classes at 8 AM because that would probably be good. 

## **Self Evaluation**
In addition to the debrief, the Self Evaluation is an opportunity for you to talk about your work. You must rate each aspect of your project as a 1 - 5 or Pass/Fail (where appropriate), as well as write a short 1-2 sentence elaboration to justify your score, in the following areas:


**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 4

*I think that my project fits pretty well within the theme of "secret" but it would've made more sense if I did my previous idea instead. I understand that my previous idea would've been terrible for a two week project though.*


**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 5


*I think I scoped it pretty well despite the fact that I didn't sleep for like two nights right before class but that wasn't a scoping problem that was a me, personally problem. I was able to complete the game and have a pretty finished looking product at the end so I think the scope fit the project very well.*


**Overall** - Pass


*My game ended up being what I said it was going to be, turned in on time, and sort of fits the theme so I would consider this project to be a pass.*
