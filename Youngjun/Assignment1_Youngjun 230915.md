## **Debrief**
Here is where I would write my 200 word debrief. Within my debrief, I make sure to answer all the required questions. 

My theme of this assignment was "wall." I walked around the places I usually go and found an irregular wall on the first floor of 370 Jay St. The wall was full of green leaves, perhaps made with plastic, but still brings a lively atmosphere. There were three chairs and a desk in front of the wall, seems like no one has used them for a long time, but the fence blocked the way to approach, made me feel mysterious. These were some feeling I wanted to evoke from my assignment. 

While some people liked my green color, I think I failed to make the whole picture beautiful. A lack of detail might be the core problem. For example, from other projects, I learned the importance of light and shadow. If the goal is not to make a perfect flat minimal graphic design, I should have include light and shadow to express the texture. When I see others' assignments, I could feel the reflecting texture of glass, smooth shower curtain, and solid columns. The use of light and shadow would also help me create mysterious atmosphere. Camera angle might help that too. My camera was not flat, at least, but maybe more bold camera angle would give different feeling.
