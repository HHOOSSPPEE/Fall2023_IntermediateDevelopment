## **Debrief**
The theme of my assignment is SWEET, and I chose the most accessible items around me that represents SWEET, such as candy and bubble tea. For the visual representation of my theme, I think placing the bubble tea in the center of the image will attract viewer's attention. Also, I remained its straw darkness as the overall color palette is very light. For this consideration, I was being criticized as lacking consistency of color. Maybe catching the exact color and nuances are the further challenge that I need to think about.
According to my classmate's advice, I realized that the space between the front and back was not clearly addressed. For example, the plastic wrapping of bubble tea and the straw overlapped. It seemed the straw were not placed in the cup. 
Still, my biggest problem is the overall lack of refinement - the plain highlights, the shadows that don't perfectly cover the shape of the original object. Again, I need to add some more shapes for the REQUIREMENTS.

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) - 5

Candy and bubble tea clearly represents the theme. Overall colors are surreal and pink, being made subjectively to represent the theme.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 4


There are imagery and feelings in the picture I created but it lacks details. However, some of my classmates' work is already fine illustrations, and for what I have done, I took it as a homework.

**Overall** - Pass

Despite the shortcomings, I still think some of my colors are arranged neatly and cleverly. I just want to reminds myself it would be better to have a more detailed and polished one in the future.
