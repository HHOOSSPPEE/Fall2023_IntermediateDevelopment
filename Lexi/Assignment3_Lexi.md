## **Debrief**
This week my theme is hands. Hands and UI design should be two easy subjects to combine. 
The idea at first was to put a little hand-like arrow on the left side of the three buttons, and when the mouse hovers over option button, for examples, the little hand arrow moves directly to the selected button.  
As seen in many games, these kinds of UI are simple and nimble, which also makes sense in terms of clearness. 
However, this idea is not that creative. I wanted to explore and develop more on the original idea, since it would be a pity to use this theme in a conventional adaption.

Later I have a sparkling idea of combining the cards and hands in terms of "Magic". For example, option interface can have the shape of a magic card, and whenever the player clicks on the option button, the main character performing and idling, will shuffle the cards and hand the player an option card. 
The main character can also be a rabbit, rather than magician.
I faced some challenges in UI design, and it required serval iterations and sketches before I eventually determined final UI design. Incorporating a dynamic, animated character into the main interface of the game made me difficult for searching suitable game references. 
Most mainstream games include a nice illustration for the main menu UI, but I am afraid that it would have weakened my shuffling bunnies. 
I wanted a clear style that allowed the composition and, not the beautiful illustration to take over my entire screen.
I experimented with image composition many times and looked for references. 
It was frustrated that I struggled to strike a balance between making the title stand out and ensuring that the rabbit character maintained its dominance at the same time. 
I experimented with putting a square black background behind the title, which made the whole composition disjointed and collapse. 
Finally, I found out for the need of splitting compositions, it doesn’t have to be a square shape, but can be round shape.

For the animation, I think I did okay with the motion about the rabbit. If there was one area, I wanted to improve the most, it would be the falling playing cards. 
It was very challenging to tell exactly which deck the card belonged to between two frames. 
Also, the pattern of the cards falling has a different direction and vibes depending on the thickness of the paper, and overall, it's not very similar to the creatures.

For programming I was just about to get the animation stuck in the period where the word appears. 
At first the rabbit doesn't disappear from the screen whether you click on the OPTION or not, but a simple change can make the whole atmosphere of the screen change. 
That's one thing I really like about it.
