## **Debrief**
The theme for my project was "Metamorphosis." Initially, I forgot to incorporate the theme and began by creating a scene with a blue sky and a green field. However, I soon realized that my background didn't align with the theme that I have, and eventually I chose the concept of metamorphosis. It looks fine at last but unfortunately, I experienced coding disasters, and the side animation of my chest monster didn't work in class. The animation of the chest monster would have switched to the left and right, just as Skitty's did.
My initial idea was to have a character transform into a chest monster when they went below the ground and then revert to their original form (a Skitty) when they returned to the grassy surface. Unfortunately, as a beginner for both Unity and coding, I didn't know how to reference the x and y coordinates. Instead, I used a simple integer variable to control time-based transitions between the two forms. My goal was to switch between the animations of two sprites, with one appearing and the other fading away. 
However, in order to make the chest monster follow Skitty all the time, I set Skitty as parent class as Skitty controls movement. When I disable Skitty's renderer, the chest monster disappears as well. I ended up awkwardly solving the problem by placing the chest monster on a higher layer to ensure it always appeared on top of everything. Since I'm not very good at programming so the actual transform process looks rough. You can see Skitty showing his head in the back.
I also used some resources from the internet in this assignment. The rainbow, the coins, the grass, and the birds are animations I created myself. I'm happy to see that my own style and online resources can be consistent, but I should become more OPEN-MINDED, to explore different styles and concepts for my game projects, understanding that they don't have to be limited to pixel art. These assignments can be used to realize more creative works of art rather than just a study of Unity. As an example, I saw one of my classmates' projects featuring dynamic animations of fishes and oceans, much like the serene motion of ocean waves. And my bird sprites didn't have to remain static, continuously flapping its wings in one place.

## **Self Evaluation**

**Execution** (Did your project meet the theme you gave it?) ¨C 4

In terms of the main character, I think what I've done fits the theme pretty well. But the theme could have offered more abstract & artistic ideas rather than just superficial variations.

**Scope** (How well do you feel you scoped your game?) - 3

It looks okay, but there's little extra creativity, no scenery, and no arts. While walking around, repetitive resources like birds, rainbows, and coins always appear.

**Overall** - Pass
This assignment demonstrates interesting coloration and normal logic.
