## **Debrief**
My game is a clone of Cuphead. Due to moving out and going back to my hometown, I had limited time and couldn't achieve the desired result. Cuphead is animation-driven, and since I'm not proficient in programming, this clone game helps me avoid my weaknesses. 

I borrowed the charged bullet mechanic from Cuphead but want automatic shooting when the player holds the mouse, bringing innovation to differentiate it from Cuphead.

The final exam week was exhausting, resulting in hastily drawn animations. Designing challenging animal characters, especially figuring out how to animate them, added to my struggles. One aspect I completely underestimated in this game is the art design. I spent a considerable amount of time contemplating what the rabbit should look like, defining its personality, and establishing the relationship between the boss and the rabbit. There were moments when I hesitated to put pen to paper, fearing that once I started animating, making changes to the character design would become nearly impossible. 

As a result, most of the animations only received rough keyframes, leaving the game feeling somewhat empty. I aim to create unique attack animations, moving beyond simple hand-shooting actions. These aspects drained me, making the game appear unfinished. The background was rushed within half an hour, lacking uniform lines or a distinct style, just chaotic color blocks.
The programming side was a disaster. Bosses falling and wildly smashing players at the end were bugs caused by using capsule models initially, creating numerous issues when adding sprites.

During the winter break, I'll work harder to improve the game. Using the completion level of my previous typing and incremental games as a benchmark, I plan to address the shortcomings and make the adorable rabbit more engaging. Ideas include adding boss running animations (the theme is "boost"), introducing more disruptive projectiles, narrative elements, and refining the rabbit's animations. Details matter, such as noticing my rabbit protagonist currently walks backward. To solve that, maybe I would make the downward walk animations or do not make the character¡¯s direction toward mouse direction.
