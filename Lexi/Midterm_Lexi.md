## **Debrief**
This week's theme is "Resurface," initially feeling a bit abstract, like an industrial term, which left me a bit puzzled.

 Eventually, I decided to create a game about pigments because the overlapping of colors in pigments can showcase the theme of "Resurface."
For the game mechanics, I chose typing and incremental. 
I enjoy incremental games, but I believe numerical growth requires an economic system, involving programming for mechanisms like shops. 
Before delving into that, I plan to use color blending as an incremental mechanism, where more blending leads to more pigments. 
However, color growth can't keep increasing indefinitely, so I'll represent it with coins.
Typing brings to mind educational games, like spelling apps for kids. 
I noticed that people who haven't learned about art might not be familiar with color combinations.
Thus, I think mixing colors through typing can be both a learning experience and an enjoyable game.
A drawback of this project is insufficient guidance. 
I've added some UI tips and written a guide, but not many players open it. 
I should create a tutorial, but my programming skills are currently limited. 
I hope to improve this aspect in the future.

Additionally, I see limitations in color mixing due to my programming skills. 
For example, green and yellow can't mix. 
To get the color of grass, players must use yellow and yellow and blue, even if they already have green pigment. 
Listing all possibilities becomes challenging with additional colors.

Another issue is that many players don't realize they need to type to mix colors, despite hints like "Typing here." 
When attempting to obtain pigments, players touch the color palette. 
Although I changed the cursor to a default one when over the palette, confusion still arises.
Despite these challenges, I find the game enjoyable and acknowledge my shortcomings. 
I'll strive to add more features in the future, like music and a pigment drying system. 
However, designing the drying system involves sprite transformation, tweaking the shop. It is a bit challenging for me.

Also for the UI, I want to make it looks more professional, regarding the outline and the font.
