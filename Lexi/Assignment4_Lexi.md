## **Debrief**
My theme this week's theme is focus, which I thought would be a good adaptation for  a pinball machine. 
Focus can easily be one of the main features of a pinball machine that affects the whole game. 
In the class, I tried several joints to experiment the mechanics.
My game is basically about a ship venturing out into the ocean. Of course, the ship may be attracted by swirl and collide with reefs. 
Also, the player has the control to use a small tiny sticks to save the ship, as much as possible.
I think there are some apparent problems with this assignment, the first being that it makes very little sense to pause the flow of the swirl. 
This is because when programming it, the programming logic made it difficult for me to turn it into the reverse mechanism: holding down the button activates the vortex. The second problem is that my stick has no bounce so once you keep using the stick ball it becomes unbouncy and stays static and laggy underneath the machine. From the current game mechanics, what the player needs to do is use the stick to adjust direction instead of using the stick as a bouncy place. The power of the vortex keeps the ship powered up. However, I find that players will naturally rely on the ability given by the sticks.
Also, the swimming rings in my game seemed awkward. The physics of the three swimming rings are tied together and move together. 
This takes some of the motion out of the game. I also need to modify the placement of the swimming rings because some players will employ bugs to score points.

If I were to modify this assignment, I would next enhance the force of the swirl.
Next, make the sticks have a little bounce to them as well.
The reason I didn't do this before is that too much swirl force would make the ball completely losing agency by the player.
I wanted to balance the player's control over the game and keep it running.

For the art, the current art style of this machine could be a little more retro. 
Right now the style feels like it's somewhere between retro and cute. 
When I took a closer look at the reference art, I realized that the retro style needs to have fine lines and bold lines. 
The colors are distinct and bright. And I think my problem was that I didn't vary the lines much, always designing with line work wrapped around the colors.
At the end of the class I added a 3d effect to my pinball machine to make the machine a 3d machine instead of a stand up cardboard. 
If I could have rendered more, it will look more realistic it would have gone further.
